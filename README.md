# TestCaseBeer

This repository contains a case study on a brewery database by location, where you can examine the entire data engineering workflow. The following tools were used: PDI (Pentaho Data Integration) for orchestration, and Python for API requests and data processing across the three layers (Bronze, Silver, and Gold).
